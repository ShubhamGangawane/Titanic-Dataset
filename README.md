## About the project 📖 
- We have to predict if the passenger has Survived or Not from the above given features.
- The dataset has some missing values.
- Applying some default Machine Learning Classification Algorithms to find which performs better.

###  Algorithms : 🤖  
- KNearest Neighbors Classifier 
- Logistic Regresion 
- Support Vector Machine Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

### Visualization part 🎥 
- Also applied some visualization techniques like Seaborn and Matplotlib :- countplot , pie-chart , distplot , boxplot , heatmap etc.
